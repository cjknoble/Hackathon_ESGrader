# ESGrader: Driving Sustainable Renewable Energy Solutions

Renewable energy projects need strong ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) performance to secure funding and community support. **ESGrader** offers a transparent and actionable ESG scoring system to evaluate projects effectively, ensuring sustainability, and social responsibility.

## Features

- **ESG Scoring System**: Calculates a 1-100 ESG score using survey data and other relevant sources.
- **Impact Adjustment**: Incorporates environmental justice factors and environmental stressors into scoring.
- **Rule-Based Recommender**: Prioritizes actions based on ESG and impact scores.
- **Scalability**: Designed to transition into a k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) approach recommendation system as the dataset grows.

## Problem

Current ESG evaluations often lack actionable insights and overlook critical impacts, such as environmental harms and environmental injustice. This creates barriers to informed, sustainable decision-making.

## Solution

**ESGrader** addresses this by:
1. Building a scoring matrix based on project type, location, ESG, and impact factors.
2. Adjusting ESG scores based on anticipated impacts.
3. Providing prioritized recommendations through a rule-based system.
4. Outlines location-specific characteristics and funding opportunities.
5. Establishing a pathway to a machine learning-based k-NN model for future adaptability.
